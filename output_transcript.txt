 Hello, my name is Irvin Othetel, I want the GPU ready to stride us here. So I'm just going to find out a little bit about the problem that you've come in with. Would that be all right? Oh yeah, that's fine. Just to make some notes and basically this will just help me write it up onto the computer later on. So just in your own words, tell me what's brought you in today. Well, I've been getting some diarrhea really, yeah, for the last sort of, well, two or three weeks. Okay, so before two or three weeks, no problems really. So before that, no, no, no, I mean, no, I've just been going normally, which is once every couple of days or something, yeah, no, no problems normally. Okay, so just tell me a little bit more about the diarrhea, what it's like and so like what my poo looks like. So I think, okay, so it's quite runny. It's loose, it's normal. I don't think there's any change in that color or anything. And I probably, but I'm just going a lot more often. Can I just check? Do you have any blood in it? Oh gosh, yes, I've surprised. I haven't said that already. It's worrying me. Yeah, that I've had for a couple of days. And is it difficult to flush away at all? No, no, it's not difficult to flush away. And do you ever see any foods that's not digested properly in it? Not, no, that wouldn't be something. No. So you said diarrhea, but how many times a day does it actually happen? Well, I would say somewhere between, well, probably somewhere, like yesterday, it was probably about eight times. Eight times, yeah. I mean, I don't think it's been like that every day for the last three weeks, but. But up to eight times a day. Up to eight times, yeah. Do you have to get up at night to go to the toilet? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've never had to do that before. You're losing sleep over it. Oh, yeah, yeah. Do you have any tummy pain at all? Yes. That's quite crampy. Mainly just before I go to the toilet, there can be other times. But then does that pain go away once you've been to the toilet? Yeah, a little bit. Yeah, I would say so. A little bit. And does anything make the pain worse at all? Um, I'm just eating. I do not like the really thing of. And you poured it to your tummy exactly where is it? It is just around the middle of rarely. And how do you describe that pain? Um, I sort of, sort of crampy. Crampy is what he said, isn't it? Yeah. And how bad is it? Um, no, it was extruding. And one was very little pain. Then where would you put it? It was so it's not, yeah, I've had worse. So I probably got four. Yeah, yeah. So it's not agonizing. No, no, no. It's just, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. And you've told me about when it comes on and what makes it a little bit better and worse as well, which is good. So I'm just going to ask the rest of the questions just about the whole gut itself. Do you have any difficulty chewing your food at all? Oh, no, no. No mouth ulcers or anything like that. Um, no. And difficulty swallowing your food at all. Do you ever get indigestion? No. Not really. Ah. Wow, sometimes maybe you're not, maybe you're not, maybe we can sometimes. Okay, but not usually. Not usually. Okay. So only about three weeks ago that you've had that problem. Yeah, yes. Okay. And prior to that, what was your bowel habit like? Go that often really. It's often maybe once a day, once every two days. Once a day, once every two days. Yeah. But certainly no diarrhea. Oh, no. And normal forms do. No, it's quite hard. Harder or something. But no blood, not black at all. No. Okay, that's great. Thank you very much for that. So just want to ask you some questions about the other systems as a body. So do you get any headaches, fits, feints, blackouts, anything like that? Yeah, I get occasionally get headaches, but do everyone get headaches? No, no, I've been getting them for a few years. A few years, yeah. I did not get any worse at all, anything like that. No. Okay, that's good. That's good. Any problems with breathing? Um, shortens of breath, cough, anything like that. No, any chest pain? No. Do you have a fever, heart having extra beats? No. Any swelling of the ankles or any difficulty breathing at night? No. Nothing at night left at all. Okay, you've told me quite a bit about it, tell me. So any muscle aches and pains at all? I sometimes get like, um, sort of weakness in my arm with headache. All right, so you get weakness, but how long does that weakness last for? Oh, I need about an hour. Okay, any skin problems at all? Well, I've had a sort of, um, a little bit of a rash that comes and goes. Yeah, do you know what that's due to? No. No. Okay, but no joint problems. No, no joint problems. Any problems with water works at all? Uh, no. No. And can you tell me about your periods if you don't mind? Um, yeah, well, I'm on the pill, actually, the, um, I don't know what it's called, but the, the one, I take it for three weeks and then I have a week off. Yeah. So I get, I get my period in that week. So the regular? Oh, yeah, yeah. And they haven't changed at all? No, no. I've been on that for years. Okay. So just a final check on your symptoms. So Tommy, there's a little bit of blood in the, uh, diarrhea. Yeah. Okay. And then is that every time you have the diarrhea? Um, well, it's only been the last couple of days. That's what's worried me. Okay. And it's, I would, no, probably not every time. But you're not coughing at blood, nothing, nothing at all. No, no, no. Okay. No lumps and bumps anywhere. Not that I'm aware of, no. And what about weight loss and changing up your diet? Um, well, I think I probably have lost weight, actually, um, in the last few weeks. Um, my, my trials definitely feel a little bit looser. You don't know how much weight you've lost. I don't really weigh myself. So no, I don't. I mean, yeah, sort of overlapse a bit now. Sure. Okay. So a little, little weight loss, anyway. So that's fine. Um, now let's move on to your pathological history. Any operations in the past? Uh, yeah, I did. When I was, I was sort of in my teens, probably, I think I was about 15. Um, I had, um, um, my appendix remained in your teens, okay? But nothing since then. No, no, no, no operations since then. No. Okay. You said that you'd take a little bit of paracetamol for your headaches. Yes, yes. Okay. And, uh, are you doing any of the meds since at all? Um, just, uh, I was at the pale, yeah. Yeah. Uh, no, no, no, I think nothing else. Nothing else at all. Okay. Nothing else over the counter. No, just paracetamol from my head. Any directional drugs at all? No. Okay. Okay. And, uh, are you allergic to anything? Oh, um, yes. Um, I'm allergic to, um, amoxicillin. So, is that a penicillin? Yeah. So, allergic to penicillin. Mm-hmm. Okay. What happens when you have penicillin? That's what I get. That's when you know, talk about rachica and rachica. Yeah. Oh, I see. So, that's a rule. Oh, no. But, um, yeah. Okay. So, the rachica with penicillin. So, do you avoid penicillin? Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. I've only had it once. Well, as far as I'm aware of any other one. I checked that you've had only the appendix operation, but no other serious illnesses. No. Oh, um, well, no. Not serious, no. Okay. Okay. That's fine. Thank you. So, just want to move on to your social history, if you don't mind. Um, but, Klausie, are you working at the moment? Yeah, yeah. I'm a teaching assistant. All right. Do you enjoy it? Yeah, I do. Yeah. They, like, the kids can be a little bit of a nightmare sometimes, but, you know, on the level. So, how's this condition impacting on, um, your work? Well, it's, uh, well, I haven't really known where I have to go in, to be honest, because, um, because if it's infection, I don't want to pass it on to the children. Yeah. So, actually, I haven't been going in the last, the last sort of, a couple of weeks. So, you've worried about the fact that you might pass it on. Yeah, I've worked with it. It's an infection, yeah. Because you're supposed to be clear, aren't you, for like, um, two, forty hours? Forty hours, yeah. I don't really know what to do about that. Because I've gone past, you know. And do you smoke at all? Um, no, no. Not at all. Oh, I have. Yeah. I spoke to college, yeah. Yeah. How many did you just mean? About ten a day. About ten? How many years was that cool? Um, I spent sure about, um, three years. Three years, okay. That's your smoking. What about alcohol? Do you drink alcohol at all? Not that much, really. Um, I drink the weekends. Mm-hmm. So, what would the typical intake be in a week, do you think? In the week, in the week, probably nothing. Mm-hmm. But then at the weekends, I own one night, I tend to go out with my friends or on a partner. And, uh, so I might get through a bottle of wine, maybe a couple of shots or something. Mm-hmm. Um, probably change the topic. A whole bottle of wine. Yeah, I think so, probably over the course of the evening. Um, and then on the other night, we might just have a couple of glasses of, you know, share a bottle of wine. I mean, that sounds as if it's more than about, um, about 20 units, um, roughly. Right. You know, because a bottle of wine would be about, uh, eight, nine units. Yeah. And then you've got the other half bottle and a few shots. So, that's about 20 units, which is excessive. Um, I have to say. Yeah. And the fact that you have more than what we call six units, which is just over half a bottle in a single session, uh, can cause, you know, disbenefits to your health as well. Can harm your health in the future. You need to talk about that. Would that be all right? Yeah, yeah. I mean, obviously, I don't want to be, you know, that's why I'm here. Sure, sure. We'll concentrate on, uh, the main problem. Um, so, who's was it at home? Um, yes, well, I live with my partner, Sam. Mm-hmm. Okay, no particular problems there at all. No, no, no, no. Okay. It's been about three years. Is there any family history of note? Uh, no, not I'm aware of, anyway. No gut conditions in the family. My aunt, my aunt, maybe, um, my aunt had some things to do with her tummy, but I don't know what it was really. Okay. Um, it wasn't cancer. Mm-hmm. So just moving towards the end, I just wanted to explore your ideas, concerns and expectations, really. So what do you think is going on with this problem? Well, I think it could be, um, an infection. Mm-hmm. Any infection, yeah. And you told me about one of your concerns about passing it on to people who have worked in specials of children, I guess. Yeah, yeah. But, um, any other concerns? Well, they pass on to me. Um, my sister, by, um, friend's sister, has got, by all kinds of issues, only 30. Oh dear. Uh, and so, it's just a bleeding, really, more than anything that's worried me. Um, so I wondered about that, really. I mean, I'm going to tell me that we'll, we'll try and reassure you and let's see what, what, what turns out in your case. What do you think we need to do today to help you? Well, I wondered it. I might need some tests. I mean, I'm really hoping, because I did have a little look on the internet. I'm really hoping it's not going to be one of, you know, the cameras. Mm-hmm. Cosianoscopy, or something like that. Yeah. Um, yeah, I, I, I, I'm hoping I don't have to have that. Sure, sure, sure. Okay. Um, I think I've got, um, everything that is, anything else that you want to tell me? Actually, I've just remembered, I forgot to ask you about travel. Have you had any travel in the last few months or weeks, even? No, I haven't been away anywhere. Okay, and you can't distinctly say that, um, this is due to a particular food that you've had, or, and nobody else has had this problem in your family. No, no, no. Just wanted to check that. Yeah. Okay, so is there anything else that you want to tell me about this for? Um, no, I do, oh, I did, did go traveling about three years ago to Africa. All right, three years ago. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. I worked with South Africa and, um, and up into Zimbabwe. But were you well there, though? Yeah, I was well, yeah. Okay. Okay. And do you have any questions for me? Um, no, how likely is it that I'm going to have a camera? Well, I think initially we'll probably run some blood tests and do the stool sample. Right. And make sure there's no infection that I probably need to get a gut specialist to have a look at you, if it hasn't got a better than a matter of weeks. Um, and then we'll take it from there. Yeah. But let me just summarize what's been happening there. So you've had this problem for about two or three weeks. Yeah. It is distinct diarrhea around up to eight times a day, sometimes overnight as well. Yeah. You have to get up to go. Uh, you've got cramping abdominal pain, tummy pain, and you've got some blood in the motions as well. Um, there's no real pass medical history apart from a little bit of migraine you said and the appendix. Uh, you don't smoke at all. Uh, now, um, alcohol, you know, we may need to talk about it later on a little bit too much there, I think. But you're worried about this because one of your somebody you know had bowel cancer. Uh, and you're a bit concerned about an endoscopy as well. Yeah. But would it be all right if we ran the blood test today and did the sample? And then I can see you again. Yeah, I want to get on. Yeah, I want to get it. And then maybe I can see you again next week. Yeah, absolutely. Okay, right. Well, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
